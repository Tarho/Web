          I taught my final course in Fall 2019. You can view a
          <u>viedeo of my last lecture</u>, which was not about computer
          science.

          Khan Academy now carries <u> algorithms tutorials</u> for which
          <u>Devin Balkcom</u> and I produced content.

          From July 2004 through June 2008, I was the director of the
          <u>Dartmouth Insitute for Writing and Rhetoric.</u>
          <br />
          I occasionally taught a graduate Computer Science course on how to
          write papers and how to give talks. I publish a
          <u>list of usage rules</u> that I required my students to observe.

          of my students and I were interviewed.
